# Status

This project is in the very early stages of development.  It is not
ready for use by anyone.


# Description

This project will provide an AI interface to Catholic teaching through
such documents as:
    Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC)

It will later also incorporate other Catholic documents such as:
    Bible (B)
    Summa Theologica (ST)
    Catholic Social Teaching (CST)
    Thomas Aquinas' Commentary on the Bible (TACB)
    St. Augustine's Commentary on the Bible (SACB)
    St. Augustine's Confessions (SAC)


# Goals

The goal of this project is provide a tool for Catholics and perhaps
more importantly non-Catholics to learn the Truth about the
Catholic (Christian) faith.  It will do this by providing a
searchable interface to the documents listed above.  It will
encourage the user to ask pertinent questions and the Christian
Faith and get the very best answers that the Church has to offer.
